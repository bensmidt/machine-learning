# CS229: Machine Learning
My solutions to Stanford's public course [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html), taught by Andrew Ng (Fall 2018).
Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). 

*Compared to other machine learning courses in this repository, CS229 is particularly mathematical. Being a course on Statistical Learning (mostly), mastery of the foundations of Advanced Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra (the equivalent of knowledge gained through an introductory university course for each) are necessary. Vector Calculus is heavily featured as well but could be picked up quickly if your Calculus and Linear Algebra are rock solid.*

# Problem Sets
There are 4 problem sets, each of which have their own directory (ps1, ..., ps4). There's also a review problem set (ps0) with the most related concepts from (Vector) Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra. Assignments can be found on the [course website](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html). Each assignment has an instruction pdf

I've written a pdf "guide" (LaTeX) for each assignment explaining the mathematics, my thought process, and overarching concepts.
