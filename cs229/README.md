# CS229: Machine Learning
My solutions to Stanford's public course [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html), taught by Andrew Ng (Fall 2018).
Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). 

# About Me
I am a 3rd year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I've decided to complete this course (as well as other public courses [EECS498/CS231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://github.com/bensmidt/EECS-498-DL-Computer-Vision) and [CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS224N-Deep-Learning-NLP) in an effort to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning from a mathematical foundation.

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Stanford for making these lectures and course material publically available! They are immensely helpful and provide amazing opportunity to learn from many of the best minds in computer science (and other fields). They've been vital in my machine learning journey. 

# Problem Sets
There are a total of 4 problem sets, each with about 5 problems. Everything needed, including instructions, are self-contained within its own directory. For example the instructions, starter code, and my solutions for problem set 1 are all located in the directory "ProbSet1". Problem sets contain roughly equal parts coding and mathematics. All coding assignments are programmed in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib.

I began this course writing my solutions on my iPad and storing them on Google Drive. However, I've transitioned to using LaTex and I'm (slowly) going back and rewriting them in Latex when I have the time. As such, some assignments may be linked to handwritten mathematical solutions and others to a LaTex pdf. Regarding programming, each coding problem in a given ProbSet directory contains a file (or files) in the "src" directory. The predictions and visualization outputs are located in the "output" directory within the "src" directory. 

Below I've linked coding assignment solutions (in this repo) for individual problems and a PDF of math solutions (Google Drive or GitHub) for each problem set. Page numbers for PDFs are provided below as well.
