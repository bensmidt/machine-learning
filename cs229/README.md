# CS229: Machine Learning
My solutions to Stanford's public course [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html), taught by Andrew Ng (Fall 2018).
Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). 

# About Me
I am a 4th year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I've decided to complete this course (as well as other public courses [EECS498/CS231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://github.com/bensmidt/machine-learning/tree/main/eecs498) and [CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/bensmidt/machine-learning/tree/main/cs224n) in an effort to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning from a mathematical foundation.

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Stanford for making these lectures and course material publically available! They are immensely helpful and provide amazing opportunity to learn from many of the best minds in computer science (and other fields). They've been vital in my machine learning journey. 

# Problem Sets
There are a total of 4 problem sets, each with about 5 problems. Everything needed, including instructions, are self-contained within its own directory. For example the instructions, starter code, and my solutions for problem set 1 are all located in the directory "ps1". Problem sets contain roughly equal parts coding and mathematics. All coding assignments are programmed in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib.
