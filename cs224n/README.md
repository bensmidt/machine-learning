# CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing
My solutions to Stanford's public course [CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/index.html#schedule), taught by Christopher Manning (Winter 2021).
Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOSH4v6133s9LFPRHjEmbmJ). 

# Assignments
There are 5 assignments, each of which have their own directory (a1, ..., a5). Assignments can be found on the [course website](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html#schedule). Each assignment has an instruction pdf except **a1**, where the instructions are embedded in the provided notebook. 

I've written a pdf "guide" (LaTeX) for each assignment explaining the mathematics, my thought process, and overarching concepts.
