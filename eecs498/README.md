# EECS-498: Deep Learning for Computer Vision
My solutions to Michigan's public course [EECS 498.007: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2019/schedule.html), taught by Justin Johnson (Fall 2019). Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r).

# Lecture Notes
Course slides and lecture notes can be found [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/schedule.html) by clicking on the top link (slides) or the bottom link (notes) for a given lecture. Note that lecture 1 does not have any lecture notes. 

# Assignments
There are 6 assignments, each of which have their own directory (a1, ..., a6). Assignments can be found on the [course website](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/).
Instructions are embedded in the provided notebook for each assignment. Along with each notebook is a python script that does the heavy lifting for the notebook. 

I've written a pdf "guide" (LaTeX) for each assignment (except this first since it's so simple) explaining the mathematics, my thought process, and overarching concepts.
