# EECS-498: Deep Learning for Computer Vision
My solutions to Michigan's public course [EECS 498.007: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2019/schedule.html), taught by Justin Johnson (Fall 2019). Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r).

Note: this course is taught by Justin Johnson, who used to teach CS 231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision at Stanford. I was going to complete CS 231N but Michigan's version (this one) had more assignments available and is two years newer than the public version of CS 231N (2019 vs. 2017). 

# About Me
I am a 3rd year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I've decided to complete this course (as well as other public courses [CS229: Machine Learning](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018) and [CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS224N-Deep-Learning-NLP)) in an effort to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning from a mathematical foundation. 

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Michigan for making these lectures and course material publically available! I've really enjoyed this course (Justin Johnson is a great professor) and it's been immensely helpful in learning deep learning!

# Lecture Notes

Course slides and lecture notes can be found [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/schedule.html) by clicking on the top link (slides) or the bottom link (notes) for a given lecture. Note that lecture 1 does not have any lecture notes. 

# Assignments
Assignment instructions are embedded in the provided notebook for each assignment. Along with each notebook is a python script that does the heavy lifting for the notebook. There's also an accompanying pdf I wrote using LaTeX explaining the mathematics, my thought process, overarching concepts, etc. So, to be clear, assignment instructions and solutions are in the same notebook (in this repo) which contains a python script as well (same name), and a pdf (same name). There are a total of 6 assignments (with sub-assignments and subparts), each of which are a directory (1st Assignment = "A1", 2nd = "A2", etc.). 

*Short update: I just realized the links in my pdfs do not work in GitHub's pdf preview. I am trying to fix it but you may just have to download the pdf 
to click a given link. 

If you want to see the assignments without my code (eg. you want to do it yourself!), they can be found at the [course website](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/)

All coding assignments are programmed using Google Colab and PyTorch.
